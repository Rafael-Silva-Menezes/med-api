## Features

- Manage doctors, patients, and appointments
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Data validation using class-validator
- Integration tests with JUnit
- Flyway for database migrations
- Random data generation for testing using DataFaker

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with the following structure:

- **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service**: Contains business logic
- **Repository**: Manages data persistence using Spring Data JPA
- **Model**: Defines the data structure

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd medical-application
    ```

2. Configure the MySQL database:
    - Create a database named `medical_db`.
    - Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials.

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
